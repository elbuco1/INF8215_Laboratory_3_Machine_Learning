# INF8215_Laboratory_3_Machine_Learning
<p> This is a laboratory prepared for the Machine Learning lab of the <strong> "INF8215- AI: Methods and Algorithms" </strong> class given in Polytechnique Montreal in Fall 2018. </p>
  
<p> The main file <bold> LAB3.ipynb</bold> gives the instructions for the whole lab.
The lab is divided in three parts.</p>
<p>In the first part, students have to implement from scratch using python and only numpy a Softmax Classifier following the instructions given in the file <strong> LAB3.ipynb</strong> . A template is given in the file <strong> SoftmaxClassifier.py</strong> in order to make the task easier for students.</p>

<p>In the second part, the students are given the "Shelter Animal Outcomes" dataset (taken from the kaggle website https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes) and have to perform data preprocessing on it using <strong> scikit-learn</strong> and <strong> pandas</strong>.
The goal is to make the data usable for Machine Learning models training. The students need to justify their choices for every single attribute.</p>

<p>In the third part the students must train a few  Machine Learning models using the preprocessed data and <strong> scikit-learn</strong> along with the model implemented in the first part. Then they have to improve the performance of one selected model.</p>

<p> The solution can be found in the folder <strong> solution </strong>.</p>
