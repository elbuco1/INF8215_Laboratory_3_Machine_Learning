# INF8215_Laboratory_3_Machine_Learning
Laboratory prepared for the Machine Learning lab of the "INF8215- AI: Methods and Algorithms" class given in Polytechnique Montreal in Fall 2018.
The main file * LAB3.ipynb * gives the instructions for the whole lab.
The lab is divide in three parts.
In the first part, students have to implement from scratch using python and only numpy a Softmax Classifier following the instructions given in the file * LAB3.ipynb * . A template is given in the file * SoftmaxClassifier.py * in order to make the task easier for students.
